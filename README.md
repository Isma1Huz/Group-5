# Group-5
-  This is the end of phase project for Moringa school phase 4. The project involved coming up with a unique idea which aims at solving a problem in the community
    through technology.
-  I was supposed to complete the project within 4 days.
   
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### First Day
- The first day was the design day which involve creating a low fidelity mockup like sketches  or a high fidelity mockup like Figma design for the
  project.
- Here is my design link. CHeck it out below.

### Requirements
--  For this project, you're going build a Single Page Application (SPA). Building this application will be challenging because it will integrate everything you've learned up to this point.
- - Your frontend will be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will communicate with a public API.
## Project Requirements
- Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. (Alternatively use an Array)
- Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.
- Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).
- Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments.
- These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.
  
Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.
- Stretch Goals
- Use json-serverLinks to an external site. in your project to persist your app's interactivity.
- Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
- Planning
- Plan out your features
- Develop user stories
  
- “As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
- Features should not need you there to explain them to users
- Plan out the structure of your JSON requests
- Project Pitches
- Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:
- The basic story of your application
- The core features of your MVP
- The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
- Challenges you expect to face
- How you are meeting the requirements of the project
- Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.

### MVP ASAP
- Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
- Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your need

#### Project problem statement
- Parents in the new education curriculum are having trouble finding the books for the new curriculum. They go to the bookshops where they find long ques which wastes time and sometimes they do not find the books they were looking for.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### Solution statement
- I  would like to develop an e-commerce website which has the all the books and the stationaries. This e-commerce site will be able to save time for the parents from going to the bookshops as it will offer door to door delivery for the order online. The site will also be able to allow different suppliers to sell their products to allow for the buyers to have multiple choices.
